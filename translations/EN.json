    "setupMessage": "You will see, my use is really not complicated. First of all, you must know that by default, you need the permission to manage channels to configure Zoe.\n\n__**1. Adding data (Aka registering players)**__\nTo use Zoe, you must first register players. A player consists of a Discord account and one or more League accounts and will be displayed in the various features you will use. You can create them with the commands </create player:864483085437632524> (allows you to register a discord account with a League account) and </add account:864483340492734474> (allows you to add a League account to an already registered discord account). To delete them, use the commands </delete player:864483339749425182> (delete the player) and </remove account:864483341268418561> (delete a player's League account). You can display the registered players with the </show players:864484040555495444> command if you wish.\n\n__**2. Show players (Aka use features)**__\nZoe has many features! But its main specificity compared to other bot is that once created, you don't need to re-run commands to use them! Here is a list of the features you can use:\n\n**Info Channel (read-only channel recommended): **\nChannel containing stats on players as well as stats on games in progress. \nExample: <https://zoe-discord-bot.ch/img/InfochannelDemoSmall.png> / <https://zoe-discord-bot.ch/img/NewInfoCard.png>\nTo manage the channel: </create infochannel:864483085437632524> | </define infochannel:1008317704400285716> | </delete infochannel:864483339749425182> | </undefine infochannel:1008317875834077265>\n\n**Rank Channel (read-only channel recommended):**\nChannel in which a message will be sent after each ranked game of the registered players. These messages contain the amount of won/lost LP and some stats of the player in the game. \nExample: <https://zoe-discord-bot.ch/img/RankMessageExample.png>\nTo manage the channel: </create rankchannel:864483085437632524> | </define rankchannel:1008317704400285716> | </delete rankchannel:864483339749425182> | </undefine rankchannel:1008317875834077265>\n\n**Clash Channel:**\nA channel that will send stats about an account in relation to Clash. It will contain schedules of future clashes in your timezone as well as stats about your team. You will also be able to do detailed analysis of enemy teams with ban recommendations easily. \nExample: <https://zoe-discord-bot.ch/img/ClashChannelDemo.png> | <https://zoe-discord-bot.ch/img/TeamAnalysisExample.PNG>\nTo manage the channel: </create clashchannel:864483085437632524> | </delete clashchannel:864483339749425182> | </clash analysis:864484042392731659> | </clash refresh:864484042392731659>\n\n**Leaderboard (dedicated channel with multiple leaderboards within recommended):**\nThis feature allows you to create leaderboard that refresh automatically. Several types are available to you: By rank, by mastery point, by KDA and others. \nExample : <https://zoe-discord-bot.ch/img/LeaderboardExample.png>\nTo manage leaderboards: </create leaderboard:864483085437632524> | </delete leaderboard:864483339749425182>\n\n**Automated Discord role by League rank:**\nYou can set up an automatic rank system easily with Zoe. The roles will be refreshed regularly automatically. The premium version of this feature offers more options (filter by server, display of each division, full control over each role and more). \nExample: <https://zoe-discord-bot.ch/img/ExempleConfigurationRankRoleOption.png> | <https://zoe-discord-bot.ch/img/ImprovedRankRoleMenu2.png>\nCommand to manage the feature : </config:864483002926235678> > Additional feature\n\nOnce your features are set up correctly, they will update automatically as soon as a game is detected via the Discord status of registered people or once an hour at least. You can also refresh your server with the command </refresh:864483000875614219>.\n\n__**3. Customise these features (Because each server is different)**__\nTo manage Zoe and the different settings I offer, use this command: </config:864483002926235678>\n\n__**4. Going further (We never stop!)**__\nZoe has many more features. You can test these various commands: </stats profile:864484041435906098> </create team:864483085437632524> </stats predictrole:864484041435906098> </stats teamanalysis:864484041435906098>\n\nZoe is an actively developed bot that offers a premium subscription to support its development. This subscription offers some additional options but is by far not mandatory. For more information: </subscription:873511500088770560> </boost:1008318131548213278>\n\nIf you want to see the list of commands: </help:1008317363529195571>\n\nIf you have any questions, suggestions or need help, please come here: <https://discord.gg/whc5PrC>\n\n*To review this help message, do the command: </setup:1016703634156822681>*",
